    "#1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "ans:- re.complile() function returns regex objects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "ans:- raw strings are used so that backlashes do not have to be escaped \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "--> search() method returns match object\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "--> The group() method returns strings of the matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. In the regex which created from the r';(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)&#39;, what does group zero cover?\n",
    "Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "--> Group 0 is the entire match, group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
    "a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "--> Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of\n",
    "the two options?\n",
    "-->If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "--> The above | represents \"or\" function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "--> regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "--> The + matches one or more. The * matches zero or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "-->The {3} matches exactly four instances of the preceding group. The {4,5} matches between four and five instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular\n",
    "expressions?\n",
    "-->The \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, word, or space character, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "-->Using 1.*1, * is greedy - it will match all the way to the end, and then backtrack until it can match 1.\n",
    ".*? is non-greedy. * will match nothing, but then will try to match extra characters until it matches 1, eventually matching 101.\n",
    "\n",
    "#15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "--> we can match with [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "-->Passing re.I or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile() will make the matching case insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd\n",
    "argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "-->The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#18. If numReg = re.compile(r&#39;\\d+&#39;), what will numRegex.sub(&#39;X&#39;, &#39;11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4\n",
    "hen&#39;) return?\n",
    "-->X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "-->The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#20 --> re.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$') will create this regex, but other regex strings can produce a similar regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#21 --> re.compile(r'[A-Z][a-z]*\\sWatanabe')\n",
    "\n",
    "#22 --> re.compile(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\\s(eats|pets|throws)\\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\\.', re.IGNORECASE)"
